## Club rules

Depending on your club and the young people who attend, you may find it beneficial to create some simple club rules.

Having rules doesn't mean that your club isn't fun — creating club rules can be the simplest way to make sure that all the club members understand what is expected of them.

If you decide you'd like some club rules, it’s a good idea to discuss these rules together with the club members. Rather than imposing them, ask the young people what they think the club rules should be (you can add your own too).

Then write the rules down and put them up on the wall of the club space so everyone can see them. Here's a handy template you can use:

If you have club members starting all the time, why not ask new members to read and agree to the club rules during their first session?
You could even get each club member to sign the copy of the club rules on the wall.
