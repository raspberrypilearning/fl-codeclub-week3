## Sharing young people’s work responsibly

There are plenty of ways in which you could share your club members' work outside the club so that  parents, relatives, or your local community can celebrate and enjoy it too.

If you do share work widely, remember to keep in mind the safety of your learners. In the article below, [Tracy Gardner](https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/5024498){:target="_blank"}, Content and Curriculum Manager for Raspberry Pi and Code Club leader, gives advice on how to share young people's work responsibly.

Code Club leaders may want to share pupils' work, and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} and other editors used in Code Club provide learners with the opportunity to share their own work. It’s important for leaders and learners to understand the issues involved with this.

## Learners sharing their projects

Sharing projects and giving and receiving feedback is an important part of learning to code.

At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we have defined our own [digital making curriculum](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/){:target="_blank"} to help people everywhere learn new digital skills, and it includes these sharing skills under the heading  *Community and sharing*.

Scratch is about more than just making things: it's about being part of a supportive community. It's about having a real audience for your creations, about sharing ideas, and about supporting each other.

If children have a confirmed Scratch account, they can share projects which will then be publicly visible.

It’s important to make sure that children (and parents) are aware of the [Scratch community guidelines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines){:target="_blank"}. Why not print out a copy and put it on display at your venue?

The [Trinket](https://trinket.io){:target="_blank"} editor (used for Code Club projects involving Python, HTML/CSS, and the Sense HAT) automatically shares projects online even if accounts are not used. It’s important that learners are aware of this and do not include personal information in their projects.

The [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/#){:target="_blank"} editor for the micro:bit allows sharing without an account, and again learners should be made aware of this.

## Scratch Studios
A Scratch Studio is a public webpage on which users can display a set of connected projects.

Studios are a great way for learners to easily access each other’s projects and learn to comment constructively. You can [set up Studios](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/How_do_I_create_a_studio%3F){:target="_blank"} so that anyone can add projects, or you can restrict access to Studios so that only managers can add projects.

Only projects that have already been shared can be added to a Studio.

## Leaders sharing projects
Sometimes it’s appropriate to share projects with parents and the wider community.

The venue may have social media accounts, a website, or a newsletter. It is preferable for the venue to share work, rather than individual volunteers doing so.

It’s important to follow any policies that the venue has in place, such as not sharing full names or identifying young people in photographs, and to check that learners have not shared personal information within projects.

Moreover, it’s good practice to tell learners if you plan to share their projects with a wider audience and to check that they are comfortable with this.
